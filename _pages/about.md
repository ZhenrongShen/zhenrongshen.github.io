I am a Ph.D. candidate in [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervison of [Prof. Qian Wang (王乾)](https://qianwang.space/) at [Medical Imaging Computing Lab (MIC Lab)](https://mic.sjtu.edu.cn/).
Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from [School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering](https://bme.buaa.edu.cn/English/Default.aspx) at [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Jicong Zhang (张冀聪)](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhangjicong/zh_CNen/index.htm) for undergraduate research.

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and medical image analysis.
<!-- , for the sake of smart diagnosis and prognosis, individualized therapy planning and tracking, and translational medical studies. -->
During My Ph.D. studies, I have been dedicated to the research of medical image synthesis, including but not limited to controllable lesion image synthesis, cross-modality image synthesis, and image super-resolution.
I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI4Medicine, believing that generative AI will reshape the landscape of medical imaging.
