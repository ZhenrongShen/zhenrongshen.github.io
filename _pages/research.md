# Controllable Lesion Data Synthesis

Scaling law is widely deemed as the cornerstone towards medical foundation models. However, the collection of sufficient training data, particularly those related to lesions, may remain an unattainable objective in clinical practice. 
We utilize generative models to disentangle lesion attributes across the domains of radiology and pathology, thereby creating extensive and diverse annotated lesion data in a controllable manner.
This not only facilitates the training of medical AI but also serves as a robustness assessment benchmark, and potentially acts as a medical education tool.

> ## *Chest X-ray Lung Nodule Synthesis for Lung Nodule Detection*
> - We proposed a lung nodule synthesis framework disentangles nodule attributes (i.e., shape, size, and texture) and synthesize nodules in a controllable manner. We leveraged the controllability of the framework to design a hard example mining strategy for data augmentation on lung nodule detection.

> ## *Cervical Cytological Image Synthesis for Cervical Abnormality Screening*
> - We proposed CellGAN, a class-conditional GAN, to synthesize cervical cytological image patches of various cervical cell types, aimed at enhancing patch-level cervical cell classification. 
> - We incorporated CellGAN into a knowledge distillation framework for multi-class abnormal cervical cell detection, which facilitates the class-balance pre-training of a teacher network.
> - We proposed a two-stage diffusion-based framework that hierarchically generates global cervical cytological image and local abnormal cervical cells for augmenting image-level abnormal cervical cell detection.

# Cross-Modality Medical Image Synthesis 

Multi-modal medical imaging information is the cornerstone of precision medicine, yet a common challenge is the unavailability of some imaging modalities in clinical practice.
Cross-modality image synthesis can impute target modality images from source modality images, which serves as a beneficial tool in multi-modal studies. 
The correlation established between different modalities can be also leveraged for other clinical and research purposes, such as anomaly detection and PET attenuation correction.

> ## *<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET Anomaly Detection for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Diagnosis*
> - We propose a Metabolism-aware Anomaly Detection (MetaAD) framework, which leverages a cyclic cross-modality image translation workflow to identify abnormal metabolism cues of PD in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET scans.

> ## *<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET to <sup>11</sup>C-CFT PET synthesis for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Diagnosis*
> - We propose a two-stage framework that synthesizes <sup>11</sup>C-CFT PET images from real <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET scans for automatic PD diagnosis, which was based on the correlation between dopaminergic deficiency in the striatum and increased glucose metabolism in PD patients.

# Medical Image Super-Resolution

3D medical images like MRI are typically acquired using 2D scanning protocols, resulting in high in-plane resolution yet compromised through-plane resolution.
Super-resolution can reduce the inter-slice spacing of 2D scanned volumes, thereby facilitating downstream visualization and computer-aided diagnosis. 

> ## *MR Image Super-resolution for Arbitrary Inter-Slice Spacing Reduction*
> - We proposed Hierarchical Feature Conditional Diffusion (HiFi-Diff) for arbitrary MRI inter-slice spacing reduction, which generates any desired in-between MR slice from adjacent MR slices in the through-plane direction.
>  We proposed Spatial Attention-based Implicit Neural Representation (SA-INR) for arbitrary MRI inter-slice spacing reduction in any direction, which can reconstruct the MR image by continuously sampling the coordinates in 3D space.
